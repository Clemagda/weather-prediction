<h1 align="center">Weather Forecast Prediction</h1>


Weather forecast prediction based on NeuralProphet architecture. The model deployed allow to predict weather for 3pm from the next day until maximum 5 years. In case of long time prediction, we observe a maximum predicted temperature error of 3°C. 

The scripts is currently written to make prediction for Melbourne, Australia. It can be easily modified to predict other weather features like rain, humidity, wind for any desired location.
